THE HARVEY LICENSE!!!! v6.9.420

Chapter 1. Intro

At Interstellar we really don't care what you do with the website. But depending on what type of mood im in, I'll annoy the sh*t out of you if you fork Interstellar
even if it is technically opensource.

If you fork Interstellar make sure to have basically no coding knowledge so you are too dumb to change our watermarks

Chapter 2. Harvey messing with ur brain or so he thinks

Forking interstellar will mess with your brain. Since its so great, you will get to popular, but in the back of your mind, you will always know you are just a fraud.]

Stress - I will find you if you fork Interstellar, pretend to be your friends, and ridicule you over Interstellar and play with your heart rate


Final thoughts cuz im bored

I hope your Interstellar becomes popular (Unless you are at my school) so securly just becomes worse and worse! 

Bye 4 now
